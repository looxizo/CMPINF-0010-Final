## Context and Datasets
This project is an analysis of driving-related data in the greater Pittsburgh area with the goal of determining which Pittsburgh neighborhood is the most fun to drive in, and therefore the best.
* The traffic signs dataset contains information about each traffic sign in Pittsburgh, such as the type of sign (stop, yield, etc.) and location.
* The speed humps dataset keeps track of, among other details, the location and material of each speed hump in Pittsburgh.
* The traffic speeds dataset comprises a broad range of location-based information about Pittsburgh traffic, including speed statistics and the number of vehicles.

Additionally, the [Neighborhoods](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/neighborhoods2/resource/668d7238-cfd2-492e-b397-51a6e74182ff) dataset was used to supplement the analyses. Its information on the square footage of each neighborhood made it possible to calculate the *densities* of traffic signs and speed humps in each neighborhood, which is more valuable information than just raw quantities.
